This week, we learned to embed video and audio codes. I found it really cool, as I always wondered what the code behind the scenes for a video being posted on YouTube would look like, and well, I guess what we saw in class is how it would look. 
Overall, this week was a lot of straightforward work compared to what we saw in the previous weeks, which was nice.
The only difficulty I really faced when doing the code was trying to keep up at first, since we were going a little fast, but in the end, I still managed to get all the coding done and even add a little bit of my own stuff like different colors, fonts, etc. 
These 3 links were the work that we finished for this week.

Besides that though, this week was very simple and a nice little breather from all the stressful work I've had in other classes.
